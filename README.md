## About

In this growing era of technology everyone wants to do exercises to be fit. The main problem they face and even I have faced is lack of information. Even though they are having the equipment for the exercise they don't know which exercise to do. So, to solve this problem I have introduced FitHub. Fithub gives details of exercises a person can do for different body parts and even it tells exercises for the equipment a user is having. With a minimal UI and gifs to demonstrate the exercises It helps beginner to achieve its goal of fit body
